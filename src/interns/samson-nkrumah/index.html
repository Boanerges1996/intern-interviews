        <p>Hello Samson here,</p>
        <p style="line-height: 30px">
          During the summer internship I would like to utilise the opportunity
          build solutions that many people depend on. Am always glad and happy
          when I see people use and enjoy a product I was a part of, in its
          creation. I want to use the opporunity to work with Higly Skilled
          engineers as well as other interns, into building scalable platforms.
          I have heard of so many concepts in the Software development domain
          which include; Domain driven architecture, event-driven architecture,
          microservices, Leader-election, Message Queue, RMTP, WebRTC, GRPC,
          CI/CD, partitioning, sharding, working in the linux environment,
          security in application, load-balancing, CQRS which I heard of today,
          etc. Although I have applied some of them but not all, I want to have
          it at my finger tips. And finally I want to see different developers
          approach problem solving and also build my customer management skills.
          <br />
          Thank you
        </p>
